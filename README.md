# Old Portfolio

This is my old portfolio, which I unwisely decided to make a website - a almost totally pointless endeavor for a Game Designer. I've maintained the site for the sake of old business cards, you can poke around the internals if you really want to for some reason.

My current portfolio is [here](https://clayodom1.wixsite.com/acogamedev "Current Resume").
